30. *******************VERY USEFUL ******************* runs same command for different files in one single go
find -name "*creport*"  ; find all files that end with creport in the directory
find -name "*creport*" > file  ; write this list to a file
cp file file1 ; copy to another file file1
gvim file1 ; open using vim text editor
paste file file1 > file2 ; contents of file as coloumn 1 and file1 as coloumn 2 and write this content to file2
gvim file2 ; open using vim text editor
source file2 ; run commands in file 2 add cp or mv so it runs same command for different files in one single go


31. diff : diffference between two files
    sdiff: compares two files and prints the difference side by side

32. For pipelining programs the output of left command goes to the command on the right as input

33. awk : AWK is a pattern-matching language. It matches data by regu‐
lar expression and then performs actions based on the data
awk '{print $2, $4}' myfile : Print the second and fourth word on each line


34. cut : The cut command extracts columns of text from files

cut -c19 myfile : The cut command extracts columns of text from files. A “col‐
umn” is defined by character offsets (e.g., the nineteenth char‐
acter of each line)

35. ls *.jpg | cut -d. -f1 > /tmp/jpegs : list all files with jpg extension, remove the extension(first word?? occurs after .)  and write to a temporary file


36. diff <(ls *.jpg|cut -d. -f1) <(ls *.txt|cut -d. -f1) : Each <() operator stands in for a filename on the command
line, as if that “file” contained the output of ls and cut

37. Filename completion: Press the Tab key while you are in the middle of typing a file‐
name, and the shell will automatically complete (finish typing)
the filename for you

we sort the output of who again, extract the first
column of information (using awk), and display the results one
page at a time (using less)who | sort | awk '{print $1}' | less  : we sort the output of who again, extract the first
column of information (using awk), and display the results one
page at a time (using less)

38. ctrl+z suspend a job
    ctrl +c kill a job


40. if shell prompt does not appear:
1. Press ^J to get a shell prompt. This keystroke produces the

44.  cat important | xargs ls -l  : For instance, the following command runs the ls -l command on all the listed files  in important. Useful for running same command for a list of files.


45. find -name "*log" | xargs grep ERROR : search all files listed by find command for error

46. du -sh * : print the total size, only directories and not folders within and in readable format, depending on the size it will use different format for size mb, gb, kb

47. grep vfrzreg `find -name "eos_modetran*sp"` : print the line containing the word vfrzreg in each of the files found by the find command 

48. If in a file first line is set of x co-ordinates and second line is a set of y co-ordinates then to print the corresponding x and y co-ordinates in a single line
cat ./eosrun/acff_125/eos_with_probes.mt0 | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)a[i][NR]=$i}END{for(i in a)for(j in a[i])printf"%s"(j==NR?"\n":FS),a[i][j]}' > violog
cat ./eosrun/acss_-40/eos_with_probes.mt0 | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)a[i][NR]=$i}END{for(i in a)for(j in a[i])printf"%s"(j==NR?"\n":FS),a[i][j]}' >violog

55. find -maxdepth 1 -name "*log" > outfiles : search only in current directory and not in subdirecteries

56. sed -i 's/acff/acss/g' outfiles : replace all occurrences of acff with acss, -i option replaces the old text in the file, otherwise sed simply prints the new text to screen, file will remain unchanged
57. grep 'TITLE' PDS_B_acff_-40.log : search for sentences with TITLE
58.  find ./eosrun_1_12/ -name "*fsdb" : search fsdb file in the folder name given and not all folders

60. search and replace for one line only
61. arc cancel <the number after #> : if you want to cancel arc jobs
